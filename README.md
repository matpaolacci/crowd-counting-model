# A Crowd Counting Model
The project has aimed to try to reproduce what has been described in the paper “Towards Perspective-Free Object Counting with Deep Learning” just starting from the knowledge provided by such paper. There are two pdfs, to get more about [my project](project_presentation.pdf) and about the [task and paper](task_presentation.pdf).
